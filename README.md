Functionality
-> One page to Add movies with different genres types (e.g. movies/series) and store in the database
-> One page to display everything in the database and statistics like total movies watched, per genre etc 

Functionality to be added
-> Clean up rows if there is an error in entry
-> Date watched field
-> Want to watch page and display list (DONE)
  -> Added a wish list page where I can add things, and there is a page created for displaying what is wanted (03/07/2025)
-> Maybe tidy up and have one entry page? with a Watched/Want To watch toggle button sort of like myanimelist
-> Episodes watched for the anime, or a season count for series
